\title{micompr: multivariate independent comparison of observations}
\description{
The micompr R package implements a procedure for comparing multivariate
samples associated with different groups. The procedure uses principal
component analysis to convert multivariate observations into a set of
linearly uncorrelated statistical measures, which are then compared using a
number of statistical methods. This technique is independent of the
distributional properties of samples and automatically selects features that
best explain their differences, avoiding manual selection of specific points
or summary statistics. The procedure is appropriate for comparing samples of
time series, images, spectrometric measures or similar multivariate
observations.
